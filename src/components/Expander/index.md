Expanders are used for things like:
-terms and Conditions
-Privacy policy Page
-Content pages
-Plan information

The title and children are mandatory for the expander but the subtitle and classname are optional.

```
  <div>
    <Expander
    title="Terms and Conditions"
    className="deal__expander"
    subtitle="Find out more"
    > These are the terms and conditions </Expander>

    <Expander
    title="Terms and Conditions"
    className="deal__expander"
    > These are the terms and conditions </Expander>

  </div>

```
